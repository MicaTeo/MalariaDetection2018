This dataset contains 2703 images, taken from 133 thick blood smears treated with Fields stain. Each image has an accompanying annotation file containing the coordinates of bounding boxes around any visible plasmodium. Images were captured using a Motic MC1000 camera mounted on a Brunel SP150 microscope at 1000x magnification.
